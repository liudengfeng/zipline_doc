    "`DataSets` are simply collections of objects that tell the `Pipeline` API where and how to find the inputs to computations. An example of a `DataSet` that we have already seen is `USEquityPricing`.\n",
    "A `BoundColumn` is a column of data that is concretely bound to a `DataSet`. Instances of `BoundColumns` are dynamically created upon access to attributes of `DataSets`. Inputs to pipeline computations must be of type `BoundColumn`. An example of a `BoundColumn` that we have already seen is `USEquityPricing.close`.\n",
    "It is important to understand that `DataSets` and `BoundColumns` do not hold actual data. Remember that when computations are created and added to a pipeline, they don't actually perform the computation until the pipeline is run. `DataSet` and `BoundColumns` can be thought of in a similar way; they are simply used to identify the inputs of a computation. The data is populated later when the pipeline is run."

    "When defining pipeline computations, we need to know the `types` of our inputs in order to know which operations and functions we can use. The `dtype` of a `BoundColumn` tells a computation what the type of the data will be when the pipeline is run. For example, `USEquityPricing` has a float dtype so a factor may perform arithmetic operations on `USEquityPricing.close` (e.g. compute the 5-day mean). The importance of this will become more clear in the next lesson.\n",
    "The `dtype` of a `BoundColumn` can also determine the type of a computation. In the case of the latest computation, the dtype determines whether the computation is a factor `(float)`, a filter `(bool)`, or a classifier `(string, int)`."
